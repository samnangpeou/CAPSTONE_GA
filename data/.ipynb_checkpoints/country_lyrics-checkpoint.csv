"Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-beautiful-crazy-lyrics,Luke Combs
"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-forever-after-all-lyrics,Luke Combs
"Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-when-it-rains-it-pours-lyrics,Luke Combs
"Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
She got the best of me
She broke my heart

"Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me

"Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-one-number-away-lyrics,Luke Combs
"You were wearing that black dress
Coat, and cowboy boots
He was there, but I didn't care
I was too busy staring at you
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin'
In the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared
I asked you what had happened
But I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me
You were wearing that red dress
Pearls, and those high heels
Liked the way it made you look
You love the way it made you feel
So I said to you
""I'd sure love to do this again""
And you said
""Me too, but I'm just not over him""
And I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me, yeah
She started calling me baby, and two years later
I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said
""I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?""
She said, ""You know that I'm ready
And I have been for awhile
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready
So that's alright with me
That's alright with me""",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-i-know-she-aint-ready-lyrics,Luke Combs
"A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer

"Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came

"Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here

Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer

"Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

"I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king

Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep

"Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still ought to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong
These days it's all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
""Hoss you sure Hank done it this way?""
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong

Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

A.M. when I got the call
Half asleep
Thought it was a dream
But it wasn’t after all

Sitting on the porch
Waits for you to come home
Little does he know
That you won’t
Be walking through that door
I just leave him alone
Cause letting go don’t come that easily
Most of the time, I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone
That old rocking chair
Sitting over there
It don’t rock no more
And that old six string
Ain't played a thing
Been awhile since it’s hummed a chord
I just leave 'em alone cause letting go
Don’t come that easily

For a crazy fool who couldn’t help himself

I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round for more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room with a killer view of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs, but all I can think about is home
I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a ""Don't Mess With Texas"" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""missin' you""
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
You should've seen 19th Street, you should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing, when they line dance to ""Copperhead Road""
Something about the air down here, that'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw, but all I can think about is you
I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a ""Don't Mess With Texas"" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""missin' you""
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you

"Honey, how's that drink goin' down?
Seems a little stiff for 2 PM
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' limes
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Beam
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone
Oh no, oh no
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few

"Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you've been well
Me? I'm doin' alright, could always be better
Seein' as you're the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow
Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down

Window seat, nonstop one-way
2 PM, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink
I wish time would fly right with me
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town
But they always bring me back to you
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you
I've spent every mile missing you, baby
It's enough to drive me crazy
""I love you""'s from hotel rooms
They sure do make it tough
But they always bring me back to you
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you
In all these nothing towns
You in this whole world around
You're the only place I wanna get back to

From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view

Tryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls

For stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and More
And all my friends would get away
Seems I'd get caught, plain as day
I took the blame for every little thing

I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels

On its damn own, should be a crime
Let alone a fool like me
Hand in hand with you, should be doin' time
But here we are runnin' free
Guess someone turned the other cheek
'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view
Guess I got away with you

Wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
Half smoked soft pack, light it up boys, take a drag
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought I was so damn cool
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, it really rocked my world
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way
One girl, 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace,to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, she really rocked my world

Wearing just what you know makes me weak

The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves

And now my high beams are shinin' on my babies road
Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires

Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine
It's been a long time since we felt that creek
Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet
Baby, you don't know that this right here
Is the same water my ol' man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away

And it takes me back to a simpler place and time

It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul

About 2AM to catch us some trout
That's when I saw that car pull up

But you look a little young for all that beer
And when he got close, I couldn't tell who that was
He said I ain't the cops, I ain't your parents
Boys you're dealin' with the county sheriff
So I said we can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a sip and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to
Me and my boys sneakin' out again
A quick turnaround it was the next weekend
We had the single cab all filled up with smoke
He came up quick and tapped on the glass
I dropped that joint and sat up real fast
And when I saw who it was, damn I almost choked
Well it wasn't the cops, it wasn't our parents
It was our old friend the county sheriff

So I sat down and wrote this song
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band

So we hit that ground a running, throwing caution to the wind
And it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shakin' that ass again

Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since

And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow

"We were just river kids
Pickin' up stones like David did
Watchin' them longnecks break off of a freight train bridge
We went to church in a Detroit car
Our daddies drank draft at the local bar
With an achin' back just like old Granddad did
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
We're the white paint peeling off a picket fence
The rust stains covering a Craftsman wrench
When the sun's coming up you can bet we're clocking in
Cash our paycheck, two day break, and do it again
We like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
We're worn out boots and old Levi's
The wind behind the stars and stripes
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup

"This futon I crashed on in college, well, it ain't our bed

Put that record on, took your pictures off the shelf

I know you just left and I know I might only be
One  night in to your ""goodbye, gone"" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
And this fiver might only spin my tires to the other side of town
But at least I'm out of this house
And this dive's tired, the band, man, it ain’t my sound
But at least they're playin' it loud
Two beers in and I'll be long gone come 12
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death

"Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, ""Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?""
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie
There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open

Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A Save the Date, best day of my best buddies life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye
'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
My first day of kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what Mama needs from the IGA today
Is just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98
With all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids

I don't mind
'Cause it's about time
But if you second guessin', don't think for a second
That I can't hang

Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast

Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time
Well most folks think I don't know how to throw down
They done forgot about rowdy
But no doubt he's still around
So keep cracking those jokes

A fireball burning up a blue sky
Mercury '93, wasn't even half past noon
Our first taste of freedom after high school
Breaking hearts and curfews and mama’s rules
I just laugh thinking ’bout all the shit we got into
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn’t much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz, that's all it was
But that's what memories are made of
Its been so long since me and Katie first met
We lost touch as all of the years went flying past, fading fast
Wishing I could make her mine
There's some things that seem to take you right back
I see her face every time I hear that
Lynyrd Skynyrd, bottle spin
I'm in her arms, in my mind
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose 
But we did

Minimum wage and overtime

And introduced myself to my new girlfriend
And there’s a wrecking ball sized hole in the wall in the basement

Setting fires on our phones
Bearing crosses we believe in dying on
Tempers flare, the flame flies higher

It's as deep as it is wide
We're about to fall apart now
If we can't reach the other side
We gotta find a way across the great divide
Sometimes it seems that our convictions
Sidе of the fence that wе stand on
Makes us all too damn different to get along
But I've seen strangers love each other
Like a mother does her son
What we see ain't only all that's going on
We're all so far, so far apart now

"Inside the walls of prison, my body may be
But the Lord has set my soul free
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn’t think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the souls of many lost men
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years tall, made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked
Inside the walls of prison, my body may be
But the Lord has set my soul free
But my Lord has set my soul free
There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I’ve got down on my knees in that greystone chapel
And I thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on
Inside the walls of prison, my body may be
But the Lord has set my soul free
But my Lord has set my soul free",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-greystone-chapel-lyrics,Luke Combs
"If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we’d met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
I know just trying to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
Well, I guess what I'm trying to say
Is there ain't a word been made can shoulder so much weight
You could turn your back one me and walk away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change
Cause there's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we'd met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

"Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances

Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy

"Unreleased version
I still hit them dive bars
Every once in a blue moon
I've got a wild card that I keep inside my boot
I've been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
Some hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do

Tryin’ to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it’s time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man
My father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up up on the wrong end of a gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Grayhound bus
Rollin' down highway 41
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin’ the best I can
And when it’s time for leavin', I hope you’ll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They’re always having a good time down on the bayou

"Well, I got a call from Rowdy 'round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin' for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well, I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man, I'm wide ass open

By half past ten, I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to twelve, man, I done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
After five diet Millers, I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, ""Hey, cowboy, could you buy us a drink?""
Well, hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'

Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this

"My dearest darlin'
I miss you more than words can tell
I hope the gardens growin tall
You're in good spirits and good health
We've traveled far now with a long way to go still
I know not yet when I'll return or if I ever will
Each day grows colder
Filled with powder, smoke, and steel
I worry before it's over, I've forgotten how to feel
I keep your picture in the pocket of my coat
I sometimes find when I'm alone it's my last bit of hope
Amidst the grips of these troubled times
Way back to you I always find
You're the wind that whispеrs through the pines
Bloom in the rows, green on thеm vines
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine
Some of these boys aren't much older than our own
They fight like men and then get cut down before they're grown
This is my prayer that our daughter and our sons wrap their arms around each other and never around a gun
Amidst the grips of these troubled times
Way back to you I always find
You're the wind that whispers through the pines
Bloom in the rows green on them vines
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine
If you should hear it's come my time
Way back to you I always find
I'll be the wind that whisper through the pines
Pitch in the black, star in the shine
Meet again on the other side
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-ever-mine-lyrics,Luke Combs
"Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine

"We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

Took all my good whiskey

In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

Like riches on a millionaire

"Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt
Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt
I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood
I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night

And a pistol in my right",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-scarecrow-in-the-garden-lyrics,Chris Stapleton

You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign

Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in

In a game that we're all playin'
You and I, we're gamblers holdin' cards that we can't see
And I'm bettin' on you, and you're bettin' on me
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin' tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out

And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights

Oh, when the stars come out

"Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love

"Let me tell you a story
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
And told her we were takin' her home
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
Yeah, she kept them safe from harm
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playin' out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet
Man, you should have seen her go
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
It was rainin' on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-maggies-song-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold

Want to leave my love behind

Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad

Is to treat me the same way, too

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway

And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town

Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around

Another mother cries

Talked to brother the other day

"Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground

"Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice

And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, ""It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

I don't like the man that I see
And the more that I look, the more it gets clearer
Pride made a fool out of me
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
When I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise
The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
And the rain will be comin' on soon
And everything's wrong and nothin' don't matter
And a black cloud is crossin' the moon

"It's like when you're makin' conversation
And you're tryin' not to scream
And you're tryin' not to tell 'em
You don't care what they mean
And you're really feelin' fragile
And you really can't get home
And you really feel abandoned
But you wanna be alone
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all
And when the house is empty
And the lights begin to fade
And there's nothin' to protect you
Except thе window shade
And it's hard to put your finger
On the thing that scarеs you most
And you can't tell the difference
Between an angel and a ghost
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-old-friends-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind
So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind
Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, til' the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind
If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-tryin-to-untangle-my-mind-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-outlaw-state-of-mind-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"Hillbilly blood, runnin' through my veins
Black cold soul and a mountain of pain
Jug of white lightning crossin' my lips
Hillbilly blood don't give a shit
Hillbilly blood, the river runs red
Finger on the trigger and a pound of lead
Chopper in the air, searchin' my land
A copperhead bites I don't give a goddamn
All the tongues at the tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
The way it is, is the way it was
Hillbilly blood, hillbilly blood
Hillbilly blood, thick as the night
Fog lays heavy on the mornin' light
Pike County Sheriff trackin' my scent
Nobody gonna know wherе it went
All the tongues at thе tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
And the way it is, is the way it was
Hillbilly blood, hillbilly blood",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-hillbilly-blood-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
But the devil named music is taking my life",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-the-devil-named-music-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
"I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Woo!",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-hard-livin-lyrics,Chris Stapleton
