Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
She's at a stove 
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope 
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong 
No, nothing wrong  with a lie 
Nothing wrong 
With another short plane ride 
Through the sky 
You and I 
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost
Faith is the substance-
