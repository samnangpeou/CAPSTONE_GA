My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah 
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides 
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' 
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' 
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No "whens", call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless
Despite our history, yeah
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me 
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me
Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens
Matthew got a lens on me right now, yeah
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens
Know I got some sins on me right now
On me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
