My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley 
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah 
Then get the scream mask for the vert ride 
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' 
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' 
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No wins, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless 
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me 
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me 
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me

On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me

Yeah, cameras, cameras on me, I need tints 
Smilin' but inside I'm feelin' bent 
Come direct, please I can't take no hints 
Bicycles and pegs, yeah
Ride low, duck the feds, watch

Money on my head, yeah
Cameras, cameras on me when I'm bent
Mix the waterfall right behind the tent 
Backseat, spacious, I pulled up, spaceship, yeah 
This ain't Vegas, yeah this here vacant, yeah 
Black skin bastard, tad bit savage
Cause a tad bit havoc, when I come through, damage
Hop out , roll , pop it, pour 
Planet froze, chain Keyshia Cole 
Molly help me sleep, yeah
Xannies make her sleep, yeah
