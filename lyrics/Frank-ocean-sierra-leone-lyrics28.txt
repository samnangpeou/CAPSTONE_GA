Spendin' too much time alone
Horses gallop to her throne
We're behaving like teenagers
Still inside our parents' homes
No, I don't live in Denver
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple 'cause it's time for her to eat 
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time to go to sleep 
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl, if you knew what I know, knew what I know
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...
