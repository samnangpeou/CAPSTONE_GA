My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
Too cold this side of June
It ain't natural
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Better leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes
Too cold this side of June
That ain't natural
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But this ain't natural
I'll take care, I'll take care
If this ain't going well
I'm no match for you
This isn't hard to tell
That it ain't going well
When we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To shade us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains
Oh, summer remains
Oh yeah, summer remain
Summer remain
