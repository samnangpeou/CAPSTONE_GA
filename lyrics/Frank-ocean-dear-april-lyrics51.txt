Dear April
The only face in the crowd that I knew
Dear April
Are you watching this?
Are you watching him dance?
Dear April
We were safe for a while
We were safe as the years flew by
If you could take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe that no matter what
It can make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this
If you can take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe no matter what
Take us through it
And wake us up again
And what we had can't be the same now
But you will make something
And it'll take you through
It'll wake you up again
Just like you made me new 
Just like you took me through 
Just like you woke me up 
You made me new
You took me through
You woke me up 
Dear April
Are you watching him dance?
Dear April
Are you watching him dance?
